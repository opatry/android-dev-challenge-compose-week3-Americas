Android Dev Challenge Week 3

Implement the design as quickly as you can. Make sure your app correctly matches all the specifications in the design. 
Some tips:

- The design uses an 8dp baseline grid. Spacings are always a multiple of 8, measured from the edge of a composable or from the baseline of a text.
- Use a 360x640 Preview to iterate fast while building each screen. You don't have to run the app on your phone the whole time.
- Did you know you can copy the preview as an image by right clicking on it? You might want to overlay that copy onto the design to see if it matches.
- Don't forget to make your status bar transparent! 

Not a big fan of speed challenges? Don't worry! Take as much time as you want to implement the design and play around with it. You might not win the prize, but you can bring a lot of value to the community by sharing your code!
